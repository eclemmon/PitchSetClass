# PitchSetClass
Working on building a pitch set class 'class', starting with a function that returns the prime form.

Still very messy, will clean up when I get around to building the class. Ultimate goal is to define pitch class sets according to their prime form and intervalic content and then create a sub-class that defines a 12 tone row which will have further methods of analysis and generation.
